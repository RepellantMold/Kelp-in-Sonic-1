# Kelp in Sonic 1
kelp (or kelp_real on twitter)'s object character in Sonic 1, basically just a generic character swap hack.
## Thing to note
This hasn't been worked on since August 2020 and I have no intentions to finish it, I just decided to put it up for anyone who wishes to finish it for whatever reason (or for a barrel of laughs, I don't care.)
